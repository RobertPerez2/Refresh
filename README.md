# Refresh

Developed with Flutter and Dart, Refresh is a simple to-do list mobile application with a twist. Designed with university students in mind, particularly for those who have difficulty attaining a full-nights rest. The goal is to help users attain a healthy, regular sleep schedule and take hold of their hectic work schedules over one clean interface.

Refresh includes the ability to add, check off, and remove tasks. As well as to set alarms and calculate the amount of sleep the user hopes to recieve. A local storage database, Hive, was used to store relevant data so users may close and open the app without losing their information.
