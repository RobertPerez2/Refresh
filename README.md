# Refresh

Developed using Flutter and Dart, Refresh is a simple To-Do-List mobile app with a twist. The concept was designed with university students in mind, particularly for those who have difficulty attaining a full-nights rest. The goal was to help users attain a healthy, regular sleep schedule and take hold of their hectic work schedules over one clean interface.

Refresh includes the ability to add, check off, and remove tasks. Users also have the ability to set alarms and calculate the amount of sleep they hope to achieve. We incoprated Hive API, a NoSQL database, to store relevant data to prevent users from losing their information every time they close or open the app.

Test with an emulator provided by Android Studio, Xcode, or Visual Studio!
